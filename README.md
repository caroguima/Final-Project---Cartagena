# genos-pizza

This is the first project of the Advanced Web Design course at UConn Stamford. For this project we'll be walking through a complete web design process. Students are given a short project brief, interview the stakeholder (that's me!), complete user research, sketch, wireframe, user test, design, and build a fictional pizza website.

Our pizza website is lovingly based on local fav http://www.remospizza.com.

## The Brief

Geno's is a successful local pizza place, located 3 blocks from a growing college campus. Their business does well with locals and area business, but the owner, Geno, feels as though they are not capitalizing on the college crowd particularly with takeout orders. Geno has also noted that his website gets a really small amount of traffic, and little of  that traffic seems to translate into actual orders. He has approached you to help him address the poor performance of his website.

## Deliverables

- User research
- Personas
- User stories
